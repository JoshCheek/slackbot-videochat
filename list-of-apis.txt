  a lot of IOT integration in there, but there's more general stuff, too, as well as categorized services you can integrate with
Wolfram
  IIRC from his StrangeLoop video, the wolfram language was impressively badass and had tons of integrations
  probably quite a few are available via wolfram alpha (total guess)

XY Findable

  seems to also be a physical thing you attach to shit you don't want to lose (do you have to recharge the batteries, or does it interact with an externally generated signal? why don't these sites start with an explanation of what their thing is?)

  like I typed "notes on a piano" and it gave me a ton of info, and had a little play button
  the play button sounded terrible, so I tried "piano timbre" and it didn't give me what I
  was hoping for (a waveform / math equation / piano samples) but it did give me a biography
  of everything you could ever want to know about the word "timbre"
  also, if I had the pro version, I could probably download what I was looking for

Spotify
  They have a crappy web API (you can't, eg, command the app)
  You can get the functionality for a remote control by using the AppleScript API,
  That does mean you have to be on the same computer as Spotify, and it needs to be
  a Mac. I posted a bunch of examples and a link to a client here https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/15#issuecomment-205142633
